A front end developer specializing in JavaScript with aspirations to learn the MERN stack, who is always looking to explore new technologies.

I have always been interested in technology, and that sparked my interest in Software Development. I learned more about the subject via online resources and began to teach myself basic concepts. I've become intimately familiar with several coding languages and participated in coding challenges. I'm very excited to work as a professional Software Developer and use the versatile skills that this career demands.
